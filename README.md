## __Description__ 
A command line interface to assist in the creation on README.md's for your projects. The readme's design is automatically created and autofilled based on the information that you input in the command line interface. The purpose of creating this was to assist me in quickly creating professional looking README's for any project or homework assignments. This CLI application has an easy installation and is even easier to use.

## __How To Use__
Inside the directory that contains `index.js`, you need to run `node index.js` to run the application in the CLI. Please note, for the installation and use section, you will need to be in the command line, either your code editors command line, git bash, or default terminal. Once you run `node index.js` you will just have to follow the prompts inside the CLI to create the README.md. File will be generated inside of `/generatedReadme/README.md`
